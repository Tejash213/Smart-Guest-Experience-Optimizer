 The project aims to enhance guest experience at events by using basic logic and mock data to intelligently group guests and plan personalized event activities.

## 🧠 Project Idea

Imagine an event where every guest:
- Sits with people who share their interests 🎯
- Enjoys activities they genuinely care about 🎭
- Feels included and engaged throughout the event 🤝

This concept uses **simple rule-based logic** (not machine learning or external AI APIs) to:
- Analyze guest preferences using mock data
- Group them by shared interests
- Recommend an event activity schedule based on majority preferences
- Suggest the best activity to start with
